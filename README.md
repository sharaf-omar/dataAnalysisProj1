# 🧠 Generative AI and Its Effect on Creativity and Problem Solving Among CS Students

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores how the use of generative AI tools—such as ChatGPT and Cursor—affects the creativity and problem-solving skills of Computer and Information Sciences (CIS) students at Egypt University of Informatics (EUI). The study investigates whether these tools drive innovation or risk making students overly reliant on AI for their academic work.

## 🎯 Research Question

**How does the use of generative AI tools correlate with the creativity and problem-solving skills of CIS students at EUI?**

## 🧪 Hypothesis

The hypothesis is that generative AI tools enhance students' creative and problem-solving capabilities by offering new perspectives, tools, and inspiration—serving as a catalyst rather than a crutch.

## 👥 Population & Sampling

- **Target Population:** All CIS students currently enrolled at EUI.
- **Sampling Method:** Convenience sampling via WhatsApp announcement groups.
- **Sample Size:** 30 respondents.

## 📊 Key Findings

- **83%** of respondents were sophomores, indicating a sample skew toward early-year students.
- Students use generative AI tools **frequently** in both coursework and personal projects.
- AI tools are generally perceived as **accurate and helpful**.
- There is a **strong positive correlation** (0.72) between perceived improvement in problem-solving and innovation.
- A weaker correlation (0.13) exists between frequency of use and perceived innovation impact.
- Students reported **moderate confidence (avg. 2.93/5)** in completing tasks without AI support.

## 📉 Analysis Tools

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook (`Generative_AI_Impact_On_Creativity.ipynb`)

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Small and skewed sample (mostly sophomores)
- Bias potential due to sampling method (convenience sampling)
- Confounding variables such as prior coding experience and familiarity with AI were not fully controlled

## 📌 Conclusion

While generative AI tools are widely used and positively perceived by EUI CIS students, more robust and diverse data is needed to generalize findings. The project suggests that generative AI likely **enhances** rather than **diminishes** creativity and problem-solving—at least from the perspective of students who use it frequently.
